Tycho Orderbook is a Rust crate that transposes onchain liquidity from AMMs into a familiar orderbook format, thanks to [Tycho](https://docs.propellerheads.xyz/tycho).  
See [tycho-orderbook](https://github.com/0xMerso/tycho-orderbook) project.  

This repository contains the API using tycho-orderbook and a NextJS website connected to the API.  
Run locally, it provides calculations without constraints, but limited by your machine's resources.
